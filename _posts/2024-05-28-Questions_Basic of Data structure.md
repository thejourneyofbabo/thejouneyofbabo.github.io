## Q1. How can I efficiently search for an element in vector, and what are the trade-offs compared to using other data structure?
**Efficient Search in a Vector:**
- **Linear Search:** This is the simplest method where you iterate through each element in the vector until you find the target. It has a time complexity of O(n).
```rust
  fn main() {
	let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	let target = 3;
	
	}
```
