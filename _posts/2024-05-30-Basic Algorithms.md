>**Lecture Notes:** Basic Sorting Algorithms
>**Objective:** Understand and implement basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort in Rust)

## 1. Introduction to Sorting Algorithms
**Definition:** Sorting algorithms are methods for arranging elements in a list or array in a particular order (ascending or descending).

**Importance:**
- Fundamental in computer science for organizing data.
- Improve the efficiency of other algorithms (like search algorithms).
- Often used as building blocks in more complex algorithms.
