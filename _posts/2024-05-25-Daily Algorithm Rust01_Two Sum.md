Even I couldn't solve it, let's have a look and getting use 

## Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_. <br/>
You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.<br/>
You can return the answer in any order.
